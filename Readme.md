# Zomato Data Analysis
1. **Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations**:
   - I performed a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the central tendencies, dispersion, and overall distribution of key features such as restaurant ratings, votes, and average costs. Descriptive statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation were calculated for these features to summarize the data.
   - In addition, I created visualizations such as pie charts and bar charts. Pie charts were used to represent categorical data distributions, such as the proportion of restaurants offering specific cuisines or operating in certain cities. Bar charts effectively highlighted comparisons, such as the number of restaurants in different cities or the frequency of top-rated cuisines.

2. **Enhanced Analysis by Replacing Features**:
   - To improve the depth of analysis, I replaced numeric values (like the "country code" column) with more meaningful information (the actual country names). This step added clarity and allowed for a more granular examination of the data by region, making insights like top-performing countries easier to identify and interpret.

3. **Identifying Top Cities, Countries, and Cuisines**:
   - I identified top cities and countries based on metrics like the number of restaurants, average customer ratings, and the variety of cuisines offered. This helped reveal hotspots in the restaurant industry where Zomato has the largest presence or highest customer satisfaction.
   - For cuisines, I analyzed the most frequently offered dishes and their popularity, providing insights into customer preferences across regions, allowing stakeholders to understand market trends better.

These steps contributed to a comprehensive understanding of the data, revealing important trends and patterns for further action.
