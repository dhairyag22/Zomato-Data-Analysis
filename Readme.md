# Zomato Data Analysis
**Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations:**  
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize restaurant ratings, votes, and costs using descriptive statistics like mean and standard deviation. Created pie and bar charts to visualize distributions (e.g., cuisines, cities) and comparisons (e.g., top-rated cuisines, city-wise restaurant counts).  

**Enhanced Analysis by Replacing Features:**  
Replaced numeric columns (e.g., "country code") with descriptive labels (e.g., country names) for clearer, region-specific insights.  

**Identifying Top Cities, Countries, and Cuisines:**  
Identified top cities and countries based on metrics like restaurant count and ratings. Analyzed popular cuisines to uncover regional preferences and industry trends, offering actionable insights for stakeholders.  

These steps contributed to a comprehensive understanding of the data, revealing important trends and patterns for further action.
